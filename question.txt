Create a website named “My Student Info Dashboard” using HTML. The website should include the following features:

A heading with the title “My Student Info Dashboard.”

Three clickable links on the page:

About Me – Display your personal information such as name, class, age, etc.

My Hobbies – Display a list of your hobbies using an ordered or unordered list.

My Favourite Video – Embed your favorite YouTube video using a frame or iframe.

When a link is clicked, the corresponding content should display without leaving the main page (using frames/iframes or navigation links).

Use proper HTML formatting: headings (<h1>, <h2>), paragraphs (<p>), lists (<ul> or <ol>), and links (<a>).

Ensure the website is fully functional and displays content correctly in the respective section when a link is clicked.
